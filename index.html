  <h2> By a Medicine Student </h2>
  <br>
  <p> Look: there're a lot of difficulties when're you're adapted to other learning standards. <br>

  <ul>
    Difficults:
    <li class="negrito"> We're adapted to memorizing </li>
    <li class="italico"> We usually don't like abstracting things... </li>
  </ul>
